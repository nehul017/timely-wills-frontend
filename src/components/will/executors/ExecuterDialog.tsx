          An executor is responsible for carrying out the instructions of your
          will after your death. This process is known as &quot;administering
          your estate.&quot; The executorâ€™s duties include managing your
          finances, ensuring that any debts or taxes are paid, and distributing
          the remaining assets according to your will. It is a significant
          responsibility.
